:blush: I'm now a third-year Ph.D. student at Tianjin University, and my adviser is Professor [Qinghua Hu](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/huqinghua/index.html). I received my M.E. degree from Tianjin University in 2022, and my B.E. degree from Shanxi University in 2019. I'm now focusing on machine learning, time series forecasting, and space weather forecasting.
